# Linear Stability Analysis of Prandtl Slope Flows
This is a graduate-level fluid mechanics class assignment. The Matlab code (LSA_PrSlopeFlow_partial.m) is partially complete. The code needs the chebdif.m script to work. The intent with a partially complete code is that instructors could use it as an assignment for their students and expect them to fill in the missing parts and make the code work. Instructors could request the complete matlab code by contacting Inanc Senocak at senocak@pitt.edu. The request must come from an email address affiliated with a university. Instructors should provide their current position and the class in which they are going to use the material. The complete code is only for instructors so that the assignment stays original. Instructors are not allowed to share the complete matlab code with other researchers or students or post the material on any website private or public. Students could use the following two articles to learn about linear stability analysis of Prandtl slope flows and reproduce some of the results in those works.

Linear stability analysis of **katabatic** Prandtl slope flows is explained in the following work: 

  Xiao, C., & Senocak, I. (2019). Stability of the Prandtl model for katabatic slope flows. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 865, R2. [link to the article](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2019.132)

Linear stability analysis of **anabatic** Prandtl slope flows is explained in the following work: 

  Xiao, C., & Senocak, I. (2020). Stability of the anabatic Prandtl slope flow in a stably stratified medium. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 885, A13. [link to the article](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2019.981)
