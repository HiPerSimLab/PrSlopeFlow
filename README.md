# Linear Stability Analysis of Prandtl Slope Flows
This is a graduate-level fluid mechanics class project. The Matlab code posted here is partially complete. The intent is that instructors could assign the partially complete code as an assignment to their students and expect them to fill in the missing partsand make the code work. Instructors could request the complete matlab code by contacting Inanc Senocak at senocak@pitt.edu. The request must come from an email address affiliated with a university. Instructors should provide their current position and the class in which they are going to use the material. We limit the access to the complete code for instructors only so that the project stays original as an assignment. Instructors are not allowed to share the complete matlab code with others researchers or students or post the material on any website private or public.
